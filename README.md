# CS 008 - DATA STRUCTURES at Pasadena City College

## Description

All the files and projects for CS 8 class with Professor Sassan Barkeshli at Pasadena City college in Spring 2020

### Directory structure

The files and folders structure consists of and [!includes](./Projects/!includes/) directory as the main library and numbered directories for small projects.

- ### [!includes Directory](./Projects/!includes/)

  This directory contains all the header and source files for fundamental data structure classes and their test files. In addition it also contains some classes outside of data structure topics that are used throughout the entire course.

- #### [The Numbered directories](./Projects/)

  This directories that start with numbers hold test files and projects derived from the classes in the [!includes](./Projects/!includes/) directory. The `source` directory under this directory hold the test main.cpp and sample test files. Some `source` directories also contain a `.pro` file that holds all the dependencies needed for that project.This `.pro` file was automatically created with [!`Qt Creator`](https://www.qt.io/product) IDE

  The numbered directories also holds an `output` directory that holds the sample outputs for these tests. The doc directory holds the work report for the main data structure classes. The resource or build directories hold the resources used with that project to run the test files such as `.txt` and `.bin` files
