                     that controls the runway and processes takeoff and landing
                     Queue class
                        big three , Empty(), Front(), Pop(),
                         Push () and Size()
                     list functions ( a much improved list function from
                                         the stack and queue project)
                        all the required plus a search function
                        that utilizes only the _next of a node,

    Reflections:
        - The hardest part from this project was understanding how the
          car_washing_simulation was performed. once I understood how it
          was written and how it worked, it was easier to implement the
          airport simulation.
          One thing I noticed is the higher the landing probability,
          there were several planes that crashed, and there were very few
          planes takingoff.
