Features:
    - Not Implemented: None

    - Implemented:
                 bubble sort
                 insertion sort
                 heap sort  from heap class
                 merge sort
                 quick sort

    - Partly implemented: None

Bugs:
    - none

Reflections:
    - sorting functions were not hard to write but it requires careful
      investigation. most of the time i was off by on and it was just
      tedious to write them and the test functions

Note:
    - for heap sort I just called heap class and inserted elements
      in the array and popped the heap and inserted them at the
      in ascending order

      i had my own swap function but since we're calling all sort
      libraries on main simultaneously, compiler couldn't compile so
      i just deleted them and used the build in swap function instead
