    Features:
        - Implemented:
            BST class:
                Big three functions, default ctor and ctor with sorted list
                clear(), erase(), insert(), search(), extraction operator
                += operator to add two trees
            Binary Tree search functions
                tree_add(), tree_clear(), tree_copy(), tree_erase()
                tree_insert(), tree_print(), tree_remove_max(), both
                tree_search() functions, tree_from_sorted_list() and
                tree_traversal_in_order()

        - Not Implemented:


        - Partly implemented:

    Bugs:
            BST Class
                NONE
            Binary Tree search functions
                height()

    Reflections:
            BST Class
                was very easy
            Binary Tree search functions
                I am having a hard time trying to figure out how to
