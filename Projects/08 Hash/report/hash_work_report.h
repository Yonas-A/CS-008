    Features:
        - Not Implemented:  None

        - Implemented:
                open_hash class and double_hash class
                    all functions listed on the book
                chained_hash class:
                    implemented with avl tree

        - Partly implemented:   None

    Bugs:
        - None

    Reflections:
        - I had a little trouble implementing chained_hash class
          with avl tree but the whole project was easy.

    NOTE:
        _ I have separated the test functions in two .h files
        hash_random_test.h for random test and hash_interactive_test.h
        for interactive test

        - Chained_hash class was implemented using dynamic array
        of avl pointers so of course I had to write the big three
        functions. I am not sure if my implementation for the copy
        constructor is right. I have tested it several times and its
        not a bug but I'll ask Professor about it
