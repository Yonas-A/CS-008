    - Implemented:
                BPLUS TREE
                    everyting based on canvas instruction except
                    the above two functions
                MULTIMAP and MAP
                     Iterators, and everyting based on canvas
                     instruction except the above two functions
        
    - Partly implemented: None

Bugs:
    - none

Reflections:
    - Remove function was a pain in the neck, it took me quite a while to
      get it working and even then I had to debug it several times to make
      sure it was doing the right thing. I may have tested it a hundred
      times with random keys and with some small keys manually
