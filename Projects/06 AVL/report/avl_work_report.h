    Features:
        - Implemented:
            avl class:
                Big three functions, default ctor and ctor with sorted
                list, clear(), erase(), insert(), search(), extraction
                operator, += operator to add two trees

            Binary Tree search functions
                tree_add(), tree_clear(), tree_copy(), tree_erase()
                tree_insert(), tree_print(), tree_remove_max(), both
                tree_search() functions, tree_size(), all 4 rotate()
                functions plus additional tree_rotate() functions that
                calls these 4 function, tree_from_sorted_list() and
                tree_traversal_in_order()

        - Not Implemented:


        - Partly implemented:

    Bugs:
            avl Class
                NONE
            Binary Tree search functions
                NONE
    Reflections:
            avl Class
                was very easy
            Binary Tree search functions
                very easy to figure out how to implement the rotate
                functions. I was a little bit troubled with the return
                of the erase function however once I removed the key word
                return the issue was solved
                Had fun working on this project
