/*
    Features:
        - Not Implemented: None
        - Implemented:
                     table class, token class, STokenizer class and
                     FTokenizer class with all the required functions
                     and functionlilties


        - Partly implemented: None

    Bugs:
        - none

    Reflections:
        - File tokenizer project was pretty straightforward but,
            String tokenizer was a little tough. Initially i had trouble
            with the get_token() of Stokenizer but now every bug has been
            resolved from the last submission.

        - I do not understand the purpose of having the _pos and _blockpos
            private member variables for the File tokenizer. The way I wrote
            my program, it does not even once depende on these variables

    Note:
        - Done() and more()  from string tokenizer have been resolved and
          are bug free.

        - For sample output, I only used the last ten pages of the
            solitude.txt file
