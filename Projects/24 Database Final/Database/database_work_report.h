Bugs:

Reflections:
    - Remove function from B+ tree was a pain in the neck, it took me quite
      a while to get it working and even then I had to debug it several
      times to make sure it was doing the right thing. I may have tested
      it a hundred times with random keys and with some small keys manually
 
   - Overall, the project was not hard, however, I always was afraid to connect
     two different aspects of the project without making sure each worked
     without making sure was bug free, and I think this cost me precious time
   - I actually liked how each part of our study this semester was wrapped up
     nicely with this project, I think this project was actally easy, it was
     just that the amount of libraries we built and used for it kind of make
     it seem like it is hard.
