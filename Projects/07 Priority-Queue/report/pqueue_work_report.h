    Features:
        - Not Implemented: None
        - Implemented:
            Heap class
                heap Constructors, big three, capacity(), clear(),
                copy(), insert(), is_empty(), Pop(), size()
                insertion operator and all private functions
            PQueue class
                info struct
                    info Constructors , insertion operator, < and > operators,
                PQueue Ctor, insert(T , int), is_empty(), Pop(), print_tree(), 
                size() and insertion operator();

        - Partly implemented: None

    Bugs:
        - none

    Reflections:
        - Heap class was not hard, only insert function gave me a slight
        difficulty, but it was ok

        - I did not use print_tree(ostream& outs) from heap class.

    Note:
        - I have two  separate interactive tests for heap and PQueue
