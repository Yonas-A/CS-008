/*
    Features:
        - Implemented:
                tree_add(), tree_clear(), tree_copy(), tree_erase()
                tree_insert(), tree_print(), tree_remove_max(), both
                tree_search() functions, tree_from_sorted_list() and
                tree_traversal_in_order()

        - Not Implemented:

        - Partly implemented:

    Bugs:
        NONE

    Reflections:
        It was very easy to implement Binary search Trees. Only has slight 
        difficulties with height function
