    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented:
                     table class, token class and STokenizer class
                     with all the required functions and functionlilties


        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs:
        - at the moment done() and more() always go a step further than
        they should after extracting the last item

    Reflections:
        - I struggled to finialize this project. get_token(int state, string)
          was acting weird with the _pos and length a little confusing. also
          done() and more() in the main always went a step further
