/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented:
                     for Stack class
                        big three , Empty(), Pop(), Push ().
                        and Top()
                     for Queue class
                        big three , Empty(), Front(), Pop(),
                         and Push ().
                     for list functions
                        all the required plus a search function
                        that utilizes only the _next of a node,
                        _size() , _end() , insert_last()


        -Partly implemented: although it was not required, i tried to
                            implement a _remove_node()
    Bugs:
        -None

    Reflections:
        - This was an easy project.and its similarity to the single
            linked list functions made it simple
