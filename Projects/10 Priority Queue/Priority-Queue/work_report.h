Features:
    - Not Implemented: None
    - Implemented:
                 Heap class
                    heap ctor's, big three, capacity(), clear(),
                    copy(), insert(), is_empty(), Pop(), size()
                    insertion operator and all private functions
                 PQueue class
                    info sturct
                        info Ctor's, insertion operator, < and >
                        operators,
                        PQueue Ctor, insert(T , int), is_empty(),
                        Pop(), print_tree(), size() and
                        insertion operator();

    - Partly implemented: None

Bugs:
    - none

Reflections:
    - Heap class was not hard, only insert function gave me a slight
      difficulty, but it was ok

    - I did not use print_tree(ostream& outs) from heap class.

Note:
    - I have two  separate interactive tests for heap and PQueue
